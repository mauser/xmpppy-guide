\chapter{Roster management}

The roster is the jabber synonym for the better known term "contact list". You can easily fetch, add or remove entries.
In the most cases you won't have to deal with this, because the most actions are done automatically.
For example if you subscribe to someones presence, he will be added to your roster.
Therefore xmpppy offers you a higher level class to operate on your roster.

All available functions are documented at  \textit{http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/apidocs/public/x.roster.Roster-class.html}.
